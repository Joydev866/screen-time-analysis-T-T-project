## Screen Time Analysis
This project is designed for analyzing and visualizing user screen time data from a CSV file named 'screen_time_data.csv'. It uses Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations (though it's not directly used in the provided project), and Plotly for interactive visualizations. The code consists of two main parts, each creating a different type of visualization including bar chart and line chart.
